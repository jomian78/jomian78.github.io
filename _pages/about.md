I am a Ph.D student at <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> working with Todd Murphey as part of the [Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Lab](https://murpheylab.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} . My research topics include multi-robot systems, human-robot interaction, and machine learning. I am graciously supported by an <a href="https://ndseg.sysplus.com/">NDSEG Fellowship</a>
